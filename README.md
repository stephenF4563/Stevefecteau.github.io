# Eyes-Excersize
Description: In This repository you will find all the needed files to create a set of eyes that move with the Mouse cursor. Perfect for adding a fun creative element to any page or product. Can also be used to 
bring attention to your location on a page as the features will follow.

Usage: To add to your page, you will need the Styles.css file and the eyes.js file, this will allow for the motion and color use. The html file will allow you to incorporate these aspects to the web page. 
If you are already working off of a webpage and want to add the elemnt, pull just the css and the js file, and save them to your Main branch allowing for the call of these elements in your own HTML. 

Have fun!
